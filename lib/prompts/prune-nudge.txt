**CRITICAL CONTEXT WARNING:** Your context window is filling with tool outputs. Strict adherence to context hygiene is required.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Task Completion:** If a sub-task is complete, prune the tools used. No distillation.
2. **Noise Removal:** If you read files or ran commands that yielded no value, prune them NOW. No distillation.
3. **Consolidation:** If you are holding valuable raw data, you *must* distill the insights into `metadata.distillation` and prune the raw entry.

**Protocol:** You should prioritize this cleanup, but do not interrupt a critical atomic operation if one is in progress. Once the immediate step is done, you must prune.
